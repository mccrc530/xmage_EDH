### How to setup Xmage:

1. If you do not have java 1.7 or newer, download it (link above)
2. Go to the Xmage site and download the Xmage-Launcher
3. Run the Xmage-Launcher
4. It should automatically download the latest version of Xmage and Xmage's custom java
   - If it doesn't or if either element has updated since you last opened the launcher, click update
5. Click launch client (you can close the launcher and console once the client is opened)
6. Choose a username and choose a server
   - mtg.powersofwar.com:17171 is the current functioning USA server and does not require registration
7. Click the images button on the top of the screen to download card images and close it when finished
   - I recommend you download all images from source 2 to 7, then 1 (this will take a while)
8. Click the symbols button next to the images button and close it when finished
9. Click the preferences button on the same row and take a gander at the menu, pick an avatar
   - I recommend you turn off all sounds, leave them on if you're a masochist
   - Tweak the rest of the settings to your likings later on, but don't change gui size settings
     until you've hopped into a game unless you have a microscope and/or a jumboscreen
10. Congratulations, you've finished setting up Xmage; do steps 3, 5, and 6 when returning to Xmage

### How to look at and build decks:

1. Click on the deckbuilder button
2. Click on the load button if you're viewing/editing a pre-existing deck
   - Open a .dck file with the file directory, this is the format Xmage uses
   - Does not have to be in the Xmage folder (though I recommendy you keep them ther in a subfolder)
2a. If you're opening a MTGO deck file, click export
   - Open a .txt file with the file directory, this is the format MTGO uses
2a. Otherwise, click new
3. Your client should now have three major sections
   - The top half is your search results which are produces when you query a seach
   - Bottom left is your mainboard, or the cards in your deck at the start of the game
   - Bottom right is your sideboard, or the cards that are not in your deck at the start of the game
      * In EDH, this section is reserved for your commander
      * In other formats (i.e. Modern, Standard) you can switch these cards into your deck after game 1
4. To search for the card, enter something into the textbox and click search
   - You may limit your search by color and card type by selecting and deselecting each in the top left
   - You may limit your search to specific sets, blocks, and formats by choosing one in the dropdown
     menu adjacent to the color buttons
   - You may search cardnames, types, and rulestexts by selecting and deselecting each in the center
   - You may remove duplicate search results by selecting **Unique** next to the previous options
   - You can reorder search results in ascending and descending order by clicking a parameter above the
     search results 
   - You can search for symbols by using { } (i.e. black mana is {b})
   - You can search by rarity by selecting and deselecting the letters to the right of the card types
5. You can add cards to your deck by either double clicking it in the search result or press the add
    selected cards to deck button to the left of textbox
6. You can remove cards from your deck by either double clicking it in the decklist, press the remove
    selected cards from deck button to the left of the textbox, or dragNdrop them into the search results
7. You may move cards between mainboard and sideboard via dragNdrop
8. You may quickly add basic lands by pressing the add lands button next to the open and import buttons
   - Recommended to do this last, as it will automatically fill your deck based on the cards in it
   - Make sure to select the appropriate deck size (EDH is 99, most other formats are 60)
   - Recommended you pick a set to keep it looking nice (Unsets are a good choice for fullart lands)
   - Press suggest, alter distribution as you see fit, then press add
9. When finished, save your deck and give it a name (recommended you save it to a new name to preserve
    older versions of the deck incase you [make a mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rZfpSL1RQ))
10. Congrats, you can now create a fourth rate deck

### How to play a game on Xmage

1. Press the switch panels button in the top left and select tables
2. If you're starting a game, press the gargantuan start game button
   - Give the match a name (don't be offensive unless you want the game taken down while you're playing)
   - Set a password (or don't if you feel like getting your dreams crushed by a random player)
      * Our playgroup uses "Quack" as the password by default
   - Choose the format to play from the deck type drop down menu (EDH is "Varient Magic - Commander")
   - Choose the game type corresponding to the selected format and number of players
      * If playing a free for all game type, make sure to select desired number of players
   - Set number of free mulligans
   - Set number of wins (Best of X)
   - Set timer to desired length (2 hours for EDH is usually most appropriate)
   - Disable rollbacks if you and your group are experienced with playing magic and using Xmage/MTGO
   - Set skill level to serious
   - Enable/Disable planechase (superformat of magic, new to xmage, UAYOR)
   - Select the deck you want to be using with the file explorer
   - Make sure other players are set to human
   - Press OK when finished, then start once everyone else has joined your game
3. If you're creating a round of sealed (limited and draft), 99% of the rules from above also apply
   - When creating a game of sealed, click new tourney instead of new match
   - When creating a game of sealed, pick each pack you wish to use (can be from different sets)   
   - When creating a game of sealed, pick how many players will play per match by changing the seats number
      * 2 players min, if more than 2 per match game will automatically make it best of one instead of two
   - When creating a draft, you should probably add additional draftbots to have 8 players 
4. If you're joining a game to play, find it in the top list (open games)
   - Enter the password 
      * Our playgroup uses "Quack" as the password by default
   - Select the deck you want to be using with the file explorer
   - If you're joining a draft, you will be directed to the draft table; pick cards by clicking on them
   - If you're playing a sealed game, you will be directed to the deck editor to make your deck with
      the cards from your packs you recieved (after drafting in the case of a draft league)
   - If you're playing a sealed game and do not see your cards in the deck editor, make sure to pull down
      the bar to divide it into 2 halfs (top is your pool of cards, bottom is your deck)
5. Ingame instructions (Note: Xmage is rules enforced, meaning it will do almost everything correctly)
   - You may play lands by clicking on them in your hand
   - You may activate abilities of permanents by clicking on them (and selecting which one if multiple
      are available) (this includes tapping lands for mana)
   - You may cast spells by clicking on them and paying mana from your mana pool on the left
      * Spells requiring other costs will prompt you to pay those seperately
   - You may view other zones by clicking on their corresponding buttons next to the mana pool
   - You may select attacker during your declare attack step by clicking on your creatures
   - You may select blockers during others' declare blockers step by clicking on a creature you control
      then a creature that is attacking *you*
   - You may automatically pass priority (skip) through phases and stacks with the skip buttons, 
      Use these to make the game go faster if you can't do shit during them anyways
      * Use skip stack (F10) if you don't want to do anything while something else is happening on the stack
      * Use end turn (F5) to skip to the end of the turn
      * Use your turn (F9) to skip past everything til your *next* turn
      * Use prior end (F10) to skip to the end step before your *next* turn
      * Use cancel skip (F3) to save your sorry ass from skipping over your opportunity to do stuff 
      * If you hold priority with nothing to do, begone thot
   - The game will prompt you to select targets for spells and players, which may be done 
      by clicking the desired permanent, stack item, or player 
   - Select the order that simultaneous and abilities by clicking on them in the desired order (FOLO)

### Beginner's guide to EDH

1. The distribution of cards in a typical, generic EDH follows this format
   - 40% lands (basic, nonbasic mana producers, utility)
   - 10% mana advantage (ramp, rituals, cost reduction, etc)
   - 10% card advantage (draw, turors, recursion, etc.)
   - 10% answers (spot removal, boardwipes, counterspells, etc.)
   - 30% other (threats, gimmicks, commander, etc.)
2. Before playing a game, make sure everyone's on a relatively even power level (~2 on the scale)
   - 9-10 Competitive (designed to win consistently, will stomp lower teirs)
      * Baral Polymorph, Vannifar Pod, Gitrog Dredge
   - 7-8 Optimized (more efficient decks from previous teir, will probably win if left unchecked)
      * Azami Labmaniac, Nekusar Wheels, Derevi Stax
   - 5-6 Focused (plays many good cards with lots of synergy)
      * Alesha-crats, Atraxa Superfriends, Kaalia Windmill-Slam-Big-Flyers
   - 3-4 Casual (plays good cards, though overall deck is fairly weak overall)
      * K&T Group-Hug, Xantcha Curses, Sapling Treefolk
   - 1-2 Jank (plays many bad cards, deck is likely to get stomped by higher teirs)
      * Oloro Men-In-Chairs, Ramos Lucky-Charms, Zur Persistant-Peitioners
3. General Archetypes
   - If you want to play aggro in EDH actually play balls-to-the-wall aggro, you're probably going
      to lose if the table gets to the late game
      * Have fewer cards in lands, mana advantage, and answers
      * Mulligan to have a fast hand
      * Have many early-game threats to snipe slower decks before they can construct laser cannons
      * Have a handful of endgame threats to win (think overrun, mob rule, etc.)   
   - If you want to play control, don't be an ass about it
      * Have more card draw, mana advantage, and answers
      * Mulligan to hit all your land drops and a future (card advantage)
      * Play your answers as you need to, but play mana and card advantage as much as you can
      * Have some game ending threats, everyone will hate you if you win over 40 turns with commander damage 
   - Most decks in EDH fall into midrange, the inbetween of control and aggro
      * See 1. for deck distribution
      * Mulligan to hit all your land drops
      * Play creatures to not die to aggro and to get ahead of control
      * Save good removal for control threats and boardwipes for overwhelming boardstates
   - Combos are good to stuff into most decks as alternate win conditions, but combo decks are another thing
      * Have fewer lands and answers, have a crap ton of card advantage (especially tutors)
      * Mulligan to win (¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
      * Play card advantage until you can win, maybe boardwipe to give yourself a couple extra turns
      * Try and deploy all your combo pieces in 1 turn, otherwise be prepared to have your stuff blown up
4. Politics
   - Don't ever say you might win, unless everyone else is definitely dead
   - Answer game-ending threats no matter what (think Avenger of Zendikar, Nicky B., Door to Nothingness)
   - Don't answer non-game-ending threats if they aren't an issue for you and you don't care about others
   - Don't answer crappy card advantage or mana advantage unless you have nothing better to do
   - Alternatively, do answer major card advantage and mana advantage as they will lead 
      to very powerful boardstates
   - Make soft-allies and soft-enemies throughout the game in response to the boardstate, cards in hand, 
      deck potentials, and previous interactions
      * Beware of using commanders that rely on combat to do anything, as you'll probably make enemies using them
      * Try not to have these carry in from previous games, unless its Joe **amiright bois**
   - If you start getting targeted after deploying threats, try to downplay them as not being very valuable
   - If you try to deploy your endgame threats early, prepare to have them answered
      * Early Avenger of Zendikars will be wrathed, Insurrections will be countered, Sheoldred will get sniped
      * Try and wait until someone else has already moved onto this stage of the game so you don't get targeted
      * If your early endgame threat isn't answered, congratulations on your quick victory
   - Alternatively, if you never play your endgame threats, you are either going to lose or have a long game
   - Playing annoying and unfun cards will generally be annoying and unfun, especially commanders
      * Take it from someone who has played many Barals and Perplexing Chimeras, you will piss people off
      * If you're playing an unfun deck, at least have it be a high power level and make it end the game fast
      * Infect is almost universally hated but isn't that great in a free for all setting, try to avoid it
   - If you're targeted, try your best to shift attention to someone else subtly or be archenemy; your choice
      * If the game revolves around you you're probably going to be targeted
   - If you're targeted before the game even starts, try playing some lower tier decks and win fewer games
      * Yes this sucks, but try not to be an ass about it; you can powercreep back to the top after a while
   - If you need something answered but don't have any responses, try to point problems out and convice 
      opponents to answer them for you
      * You can also try doing this while you actually do have answers, but YMMV and you better have a good bluff
