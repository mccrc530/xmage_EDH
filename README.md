### How to setup Xmage:

1. If you do not have java 1.7 or newer, download it (link above)
2. Go to the Xmage site and download the Xmage-Launcher
3. Run the Xmage-Launcher
4. It should automatically download the latest version of Xmage and Xmage's custom java
   - If it doesn't or if either element has updated since you last opened the launcher, click update
5. Click launch client (you can close the launcher and console once the client is opened)
6. Choose a username and choose a server
   - mtg.powersofwar.com:17171 is the current functioning USA server and does not require registration
7. Click the images button on the top of the screen to download card images and close it when finished
   - I recommend you download all images from source 2 to 7, then 1 (this will take a while)
8. Click the symbols button next to the images button and close it when finished
9. Click the preferences button on the same row and take a gander at the menu, pick an avatar
   - I recommend you turn of all sounds, leave them on if you're a masochist
   - Tweak the rest of the settings to your likings later on, but don't change gui size settings
     until you've hopped into a game unless you have a microscope and/or a jumboscreen
10. Congratulations, you've finished setting up Xmage; do steps 3, 5, and 6 when returning to Xmage

### How to look at and build decks:

1. Click on the deckbuilder button
2. Click on the load button if you're viewing/editing a pre-existing deck
   - Open a .dck file with the file directory, this is the format Xmage uses
   - Does not have to be in the Xmage folder (though I recommendy you keep them ther in a subfolder)
2a. If you're opening a MTGO deck file, click export
   - Open a .txt file with the file directory, this is the format MTGO uses
2a. Otherwise, click new
3. Your client should now have three major sections
   - The top half is your search results which are produces when you query a seach
   - Bottom left is your mainboard, or the cards in your deck at the start of the game
   - Bottom right is your sideboard, or the cards that are not in your deck at the start of the game
     - In EDH, this section is reserved for your commander
     - In other formats (i.e. Modern, Standard) you can switch these cards into your deck after game 1
4. To search for the card, enter something into the textbox and click search
   - You may limit your search by color and card type by selecting and deselecting each in the top left
   - You may limit your search to specific sets, blocks, and formats by choosing one in the dropdown
     menu adjacent to the color buttons
   - You may search cardnames, types, and rulestexts by selecting and deselecting each in the center
   - You may remove duplicate search results by selecting **Unique** next to the previous options
   - You can reorder search results in ascending and descending order by clicking a parameter above the
     search results 
   - You can search for symbols by using { } (i.e. black mana is {b})
   - You can search by rarity by selecting and deselecting the letters to the right of the card types
5. You can add cards to your deck by either double clicking it in the search result or press the add
   selected cards to deck button to the left of textbox
6. You can remove cards from your deck by either double clicking it in the decklist, press the remove
   selected cards from deck button to the left of the textbox, or dragNdrop them into the search results
7. You may move cards between mainboard and sideboard via dragNdrop
8. You may quickly add basic lands by pressing the add lands button next to the open and import buttons
   - Recommended to do this last, as it will automatically fill your deck based on the cards in it
   - Make sure to select the appropriate deck size (EDH is 99, most other formats are 60)
   - Recommended you pick a set to keep it looking nice (Unsets are a good choice for fullart lands)
   - Press suggest, alter distribution as you see fit, then press add
9. When finished, save your deck and give it a name (recommended you save it to a new name to preserve
   older versions of the deck incase you [make a mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rZfpSL1RQ))
10. Congrats, you can now create a fourth rate deck
